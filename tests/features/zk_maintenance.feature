Feature: maintenance during dead zookeeper

  Scenario: mysync keeps maintenance while zookeeper is down
    Given cluster is up and running
    Then mysql host "mysql1" should be master
    And mysql host "mysql2" should be replica of "mysql1"
    And mysql host "mysql3" should be replica of "mysql1"
    And mysql host "mysql1" should be writable
    When I run command on host "mysql1"
      """
      mysync maint on
      """
    Then command return code should be "0"
    And command output should match regexp
      """
      maintenance enabled
      """
    And I wait for "5" seconds

    When host "zoo3" is detached from the network
    And host "zoo2" is detached from the network
    And host "zoo1" is detached from the network

    Then command return code should be "1"

    When I wait for "10" seconds
